    <p id="parrafo">Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't cali me a mindless philosopher. you overweight glob of grease! Now
       come oul before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! l'm going lo regret this. There goes 
       another one. Hold your tire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny. ihe damage doesn't look as bad from out he re. Are you
       sure this things safe? Close up formation You'd better let her loose. Almost there! I can’t hold them! It’s away! It's a hit! Negative. Negative! It didn't go in. It
       just impacted on the surface. Red Leader, we're right above you. Tum to point... oh-five, we'U cover for you. Stay there... I just lost my starboard engine. Get 
       set to make your attack run. The Death Star plans are not in the main Computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with
       those plans? Wc intercepted no transmissions. Aaah... This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the 
       Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There shc is! Set for stun! She'll
       be all right. Inform Lord Vader wc have a prisoner. What a piccc of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. short-circuited may not look like much. but
       she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed. so if you'll hurry aboard we'U get out of here. Helio, sir</p>
